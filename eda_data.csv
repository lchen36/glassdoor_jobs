And because we work with clients, excellent communication skills are important – both written and verbal. Translating technical concepts into layman’s terms is an essential skill.
Initiative is important. We don’t hand hold – you should be comfortable working independently in an entrepreneurial environment. That said, collaboration is equally important.

Last, but not least, you will need to be an experienced Business Analyst. We are looking for people with a proven track record and with at least 5+ years of experience working as a Business Analyst in a consulting environment.
You must have experience with examining business systems and processes to identify user needs, document requirements, epics, and stories, and address operational issues.
What makes Centric different?
Special Culture – Our people make us different. We have highly talented, intelligent individuals across a broad variety of disciplines – who are eager to learn from you and share their own expertise. We embrace fresh perspectives and each other. Don’t take our word for it – check us out on Glassdoor, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to get a glimpse inside what makes us different.
Growth opportunities – As a mid-size firm, there is more flexibility when it comes to career paths. Figure out what you want to do and we'll help you figure out how to get there.
Impact – We think of ourselves as a big company with a small company feel – a local player with global reach that combines business, technology and industry expertise.
Unmatched Experiences – We are allowed to be ourselves here. We are encouraged to be human. It’s at the root of who we are as a firm and why we’re here.
Innovation – We value passion, determination, perseverance, and innovation. We are inspired because we believe in what we are doing and where we are going.
Passion for the greater good – We are steadfast in our devotion to the communities we serve and in actively promoting employee involvement in community improvement projects.
The Nitty Gritty – Along with the standard health and 401k benefits, we offer self-managed PTO (manage your own work-life balance!), a company paid trip, profit sharing, parental leave and remote working options for our employees.

Job Description


We are looking for a Business Analyst to join the ThreatConnect Engineering Team. Cyber threats are ever present and constantly evolving, leaving major companies all over the world at risk. This is where ThreatConnect steps in. So if you’re interested in having a real impact on the security landscape of these companies by working on an intelligent innovative product, this might be the role for you.

Job descriptions are by nature, extremely specific. While it may seem like we’re looking for a very specific candidate, we encourage you to apply if: you have an insatiable passion for learning new products, designing intelligent solutions, and love seeing your hard work come to life for our users.


About You


You crave knowledge and experience. You’re the kind of person who looks for opportunities to learn new technologies and gain knowledge. Once you finish one task you are ready to gain experience from the next.

You are a great communicator. You are comfortable speaking with stakeholders that have a variety of backgrounds: engineers, security analysts, and customers alike. The medium doesn’t matter, slide decks and written functional requirements are all just a way to make sure we’re able to find the signal in the noise the right way.

You are detail-oriented. You’re the kind of person who won’t just close a tab and say “that’s probably close enough.” You naturally try to optimize solutions to problems in your life. You prefer your requirements to read like a bulletproof set of rules to a game, rather than buzzword soup. You like thinking through the corner cases of a dataset to figure out where the landmines might be hidden before you step on them.

You are a tinkerer. As a person you love to build new skills and get excited about new subject matter. You relish the idea of applying your skills to other facets of your life outside of work. Learning is a constant for you, where any problem without an immediate solution is just an opportunity to grow and master something new.

You get restless when things get “stagnant”. We’re looking to do better than just getting more requirements; we want the right requirements. You want our products to be invaluable and help make our users more efficient. When the game changes beneath your feet, you’re excited to start running in a new direction.

In this role you'll get to...

Analyze existing integrations to ensure consistency and best practices across all Apps and Integrations.
Understand our product offering and how it maps to the user needs to inform your decision on integrations designs and requirements.

On day one we'll expect you to...
Write technical functional requirements
Analyze and interact with third party APIs, including understanding returned data sets and how they are applicable to the current project
Write code. Not a developer, but someone who can keep up with one!
At 3 months we’ll expect you to…
Be able to write functional requirements, with guidance from technical PM, of low to moderate sophistication.
Be able to conduct basic validation of requested features.
Work with other PM and Engineering stakeholders to start developing an understanding of business needs.
At 6 months we’ll expect you to..
Be able to write functional requirements, with guidance from strategic PM, of more sophisticated feature requests.
Conduct more sophisticated validation of requested features.
Start validating App catalog for consistency between Apps.
At 12 months we’ll expect you to..
Do the above with minimal guidance
Inform the optimization of PM/Engineering processes based on the problems you encounter in day-to-day operations
Be comfortable working with internal AND external stakeholders to ensure holistic understanding of the problem space
Our team emphasizes…
Open minded, independent group of engineers working on a common goal
This job is awesome because…
You get to play with products/technology that many fortune 500 companies use in their environments
Your contribution has a direct impact on helping our customers
You get to work with sharp people from all walks of life who are intent on building the best products possible

Job Description

We are looking for a Business Analyst to join the ThreatConnect Analytics Team. Cyber threats are ever present and constantly evolving, leaving major companies all over the world at risk. This is where ThreatConnect steps in. So if you’re interested in having a real impact on the security landscape of these companies by working on an intelligent innovative product, this might be the role for you.

Job descriptions are by nature, extremely specific. While it may seem like we’re looking for a very specific candidate, we encourage you to apply if: you have an insatiable passion for finding insights in data and love seeing those insights come to life for our users.

About You

You are big on data. You’re the kind of person who sees data and can’t wait to crack open a spreadsheet to start poking and prodding. The thought of mining every row and column, testing every hypothesis, and finding the story within the data has you ready to jump in. For you, there’s nothing better than the feeling you get when you find the “breaking point” or the right visual to show off the trend you found.

You are a great communicator. You are comfortable speaking with stakeholders that have a variety of backgrounds: engineers, security analysts, and customers alike. The medium doesn’t matter, slide decks and written functional requirements are all just a way to make sure we’re able to find the signal in the noise the right way.

You are detail-oriented. You’re the kind of person who won’t just close a tab and say “that’s probably close enough.” You naturally try to optimize solutions to problems in your life. You prefer your requirements to read like a bulletproof set of rules to a game, rather than buzzword soup. You like thinking through the corner cases of a dataset to figure out where the landmines might be hidden before you step on them.

You are a tinkerer. As a person you love to build new skills and get excited about new subject matter. You relish the idea of applying your skills to other facets of your life outside of work. Learning is a constant for you, where any problem without an immediate solution is just an opportunity to grow and master something new.

You get restless when things get “stagnant.” We’re looking to do better than just getting more data; we want the right data. You want our output to be digestible and help make awesome decisions in a way that delights our users. When the game changes beneath your feet, you’re excited to start running in a new direction.

Things You Will Do
Understand our product offering and how it maps to user needs to inform your relentless pursuit of data-driven solutions

Centralize your intelligence, establish process consistency, scale operations, and measure your effectiveness in one place. To learn more about our threat intelligence platform (TIP) or security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions, visit ThreatConnect.com.

Job Description

We are looking for a Business Analyst to join the ThreatConnect Analytics Team. Cyber threats are ever present and constantly evolving, leaving major companies all over the world at risk. This is where ThreatConnect steps in. So if you’re interested in having a real impact on the security landscape of these companies by working on an intelligent innovative product, this might be the role for you.

Job descriptions are by nature, extremely specific. While it may seem like we’re looking for a very specific candidate, we encourage you to apply if: you have an insatiable passion for finding insights in data and love seeing those insights come to life for our users.

About You

You are big on data. You’re the kind of person who sees data and can’t wait to crack open a spreadsheet to start poking and prodding. The thought of mining every row and column, testing every hypothesis, and finding the story within the data has you ready to jump in. For you, there’s nothing better than the feeling you get when you find the “breaking point” or the right visual to show off the trend you found.

You are a great communicator. You are comfortable speaking with stakeholders that have a variety of backgrounds: engineers, security analysts, and customers alike. The medium doesn’t matter, slide decks and written functional requirements are all just a way to make sure we’re able to find the signal in the noise the right way.

You are detail-oriented. You’re the kind of person who won’t just close a tab and say “that’s probably close enough.” You naturally try to optimize solutions to problems in your life. You prefer your requirements to read like a bulletproof set of rules to a game, rather than buzzword soup. You like thinking through the corner cases of a dataset to figure out where the landmines might be hidden before you step on them.

You are a tinkerer. As a person you love to build new skills and get excited about new subject matter. You relish the idea of applying your skills to other facets of your life outside of work. Learning is a constant for you, where any problem without an immediate solution is just an opportunity to grow and master something new.

You get restless when things get “stagnant.” We’re looking to do better than just getting more data; we want the right data. You want our output to be digestible and help make awesome decisions in a way that delights our users. When the game changes beneath your feet, you’re excited to start running in a new direction.

Things You Will Do
Understand our product offering and how it maps to user needs to inform your relentless pursuit of data-driven solutions
Analyze prospective data sources (via: SQL, spreadsheets, or even light scripting) to identify business logic needs and quantify business value where possible
Translate business logic needs into functional requirements for our Analytics and Core Product Engineering teams in a thorough and timely fashion

In a single year, we unlocked 115,000 jobs and contributed $8 billion to the global economy. There’s never been a better time to join!

Be part of the team that changes everything. Let’s build the place where small businesses can get the funding they need to win and leave a legacy behind, forever.

This role sits within “Business Services”. The engine of Funding Circle - we keep FC running. Whatever the subject area, we turn dreams into reality and help small business win. Funding Circle Marketing drives growth, but not just Funding Circle’s. We connect small businesses with the funds they need to grow to help small businesses continue to play a vital role in the U.S. economy. We are ambitious and passionate about helping more small businesses.

About the role:

Marketing Operations is the backbone of any successful marketing team and Marketing Analytics is the source of tangible value. We are seeking an analyst to assist with both, with the overarching goal of enabling Marketing team members to drive value. You have the ability to improve not only the pipes behind the scenes but determine how the team tests into new initiatives and surface insights to drive better outcomes. As such, you will focus on keeping the lights on today, improving processes for tomorrow, and supporting innovative acquisition efforts to drive growth well into the future.

Digital Marketing: you will be responsible for the pipelines between marketing platforms (such as Facebook, Google Ads), our website, and management/measurement/visualization platforms such as Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics and Tableau.

Offline Marketing: you will be responsible for the process to get campaigns out the door and create measurement frameworks to monitor success and weave together a comprehensive (offline and online) view of success.

This role requires someone who's analytical, detail oriented and has baseline knowledge of the digital marketing landscape and marketing attribution. You enjoy diving into data to analyze performance just as much as you enjoy designing a framework to enable that analysis. You believe done is better than perfect but recognize you can’t scale on a flimsy foundation. You thrive in a fast-paced environment but can stay engaged with routine tasks.

As the Marketing Operations Analyst you will be responsible for…

Marketing Infrastructure:

Tactical:
You will own Google Tag Manager and the process by which our website communicates with external management/measurement tools and platforms
You will own existing and develop new ETL processes to ensure internal access to marketing platform data and accurate data sources for internal reporting. This includes liaising with the Data Team to identify, fix, and improve our data pipelines.
You will oversee day-to-day data execution and define and document business practices
Strategic:
Work with manager and campaign managers to determine pixel set-up that reflects platform limitations and measurement framework.
Marketing Reporting:

Tactical:
You will own Tableau based reports to ensure key stakeholders have access to accurate and timely information at varying levels of granularity
You will oversee reporting tools to ensure items are entered correctly by team members and reflected correctly in end-user reports
You will provide overviews of Marketing’s performance to key stakeholders and, with the help of your manager, craft the narrative.
Strategic:
You will continuously question processes and refine, rebuild, and create reports to serve existing and future needs with a focus on surfacing insights.
Marketing Analytics
Tactical:
Thrive in a data-driven, test-and-learn culture with your passion for telling stories with data - not only surfacing marketing (online and offline) and social media insights, but also presenting these insights and recommendations to the wider organization, including executives, to influence change.
Apply sophisticated computational, statistical, and modeling techniques in support of campaign optimization; techniques include A/B and multivariate testing, predictive analysis, data mining, marketing mix modeling, attribution modeling
You will assist channel managers in tying platform’s source of truth to internal metrics with a goal of improving efficiency and conversion through underwritten funnel.
You will conduct ad-hoc analysis to dig into performance and answer marketing related questions for key stakeholders including Risk
Strategic:
You will constantly innovate on measurement framework to assist with spend allocation decisions, campaign execution, and internal storytelling
About you:
3+ years in Marketing data analytics. An understanding of the digital and offline marketing landscape and management/measurement tools. Advanced proficiency with Excel and data evaluation skills.
Hands-on experience applying statistical approaches/concepts, including A/B tests, credibility, statistical significance, and multivariate testing
Experience running existing and writing new SQL based queries
Attention to detail and the ability to understand the nuances of marketing programs and digital tracking
Bias towards action. Some questions just need answers while others should fuel further investigation. Proactively probing data, asking questions, and seeking clarity.
Demonstrated willingness to learn and a curious nature. We have a great team but sometimes you will become the SME on a tool you have never used before. Be open, flexible, and eager to expand your skill set.
Extremely detail and process-oriented with a drive to improve whatever you touch. A view that the current way does not mean it is right, based on a philosophy that done is better than perfect but scale isn’t possible on a flimsy foundation.
Bonus:
Familiarity with business intelligence tools (Tableau, etc)
Experience with tag management tools (Google Tag Manager, etc) and exposure to engineering component
It’s in our differences that we find our strengths.

At Funding Circle, we celebrate and support the differences that make you, you. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and affirmative action employer. We truly believe that diversity makes us better.

A Financial Analyst at AES Distributed Energy is involved in both corporate and project level financing activities and works closely with equity investors and lending partners to complete complex financial transactions. The Analyst will report directly to a Manager but will ultimately support the Chief Financial Officer in all aspects of evaluating investment and development opportunities pertaining to solar energy projects and battery storage technology.
Responsibilities:

Financial Modeling
Analysts must report on key investment metrics of potential acquisition opportunities.
Internal Rate of Return, Net-Present Value, and Dividend Yield.
Due to the complexity of renewable energy financial structures, earnings calculations for solar project investments are often different than cash proceeds. These calculations require a basic understanding of partnership tax and book accounting concepts.
Analysts must be able to size investments from “tax equity investors”. These investments are specifically suited to provide the investor tax benefits that accrue from being an equity partner in a company that owns a solar project or multiple solar projects. To be considered a tax equity partner, there are specific parameters that guide investments which an analyst must be able to identify and structure. To do so requires a strong understanding of key financial concepts such as tax depreciation, capital accounts, and investment basis.
Analysts must be able to size debt investments from our lending partners. The analyst must be able to interpret various terms presented by debt providers to correctly size the debt principal and amortization schedule and will serve as the primary resource for large financial instructions during their due diligence process leading up to credit committee.
Analysts must be able to track complex interest rate hedge positions, particularly in a volatile interest rate environment. Such responsibilities include monitoring swap positions and tracking the Maximum Probable Exposure of executed derivatives. These responsibilities require a basic understanding of interest rate swaps and the ability to compare swaps against debt amortization profiles. Analysts must be able to work with the Technical Accounting team to track swaps and ensure that all swaps qualify for hedge accounting to ensure that mark-to-market losses do not flow through to the income statement.
Analysts will assist with company valuation, which is an aggregation of all the company’s holdings and investments. This requires attention to detail and an understanding of how cash flows through the organization.
Deal Execution and Transaction Management
Analysts will work closely with external parties to facilitate the accurate and timely closing of each transaction. This includes direct collaboration with investment banks, lenders, independent engineers, developers, insurers, appraisers, and consultants.
Analysts will support the negotiation of complex financial documents through analysis of various terms within many different agreements. Analysts are expected to measure the impact of proposed financial terms, run sensitivities of financial models accounting for all perceived risks, and provide language to legal agreements that accurately reflects the transaction. To do so requires a basic understanding of contract structure and a familiarity with the financial concepts present in financing agreements.
Analysts will advise on the economic results of different financial structures. Analysts must understand how cash moves between legal entities and understand the potential tax consequences that result.
Skills and Qualifications:
Prior experience working in a transaction focused role (energy experience preferred).
Demonstrated financial acumen and experience constructing and maintaining complex financial models using Microsoft Excel.
Undergraduate business degree required. Preferred focus in Finance.
Demonstrated teamwork skills; ability to work collaboratively with others to achieve objectives.
Ability to set and meet realistic deadlines.
Willingness to travel approximately 10% of working days.
Outstanding interpersonal skills.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
